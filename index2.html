          <h2>Personal Summary</h2>
          <p>Aspiring engineer with a dedicated interest in all things new and advancing in both electronic and mechanical fields. With hobbies in electronic assembly, coding, and design, I utilise CAD and 3D design software. I am fascinated by new ways of designing and improving efficiency, especially through re-engineering and component selection in my projects. With experience in electronics and material fabrication processes, both individually and as part of a team, I understand the fundamentals of what it takes to produce an innovative product, lead, and be a team player. I continue to learn from those around me and have a keen eye for improvement.</p>
